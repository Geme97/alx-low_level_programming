# Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming

This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and
algorithm track at ALX software engineering. In these projects, which  occurred
throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data
structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while
working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. C - Hello, World](./0x00-hello_world)
* [0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while](./0x01-variables_if_else_while)
* [0x02. C - Functions, nested loops](./0x02-functions_nested_loops)
* [0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops](./0x04-more_functions_nested_loops)
* [0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings](./0x06-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings](./0x07-pointers_arrays_strings)
* [0x08. C - Recursion](./0x07-recursion)
* [0x09. C - Static libraries](./0x08-static_libraries)
* [0x0A. C - argc, argv](./0x09-argc_argv)
* [0x0B. C - malloc, free](./0x0A-malloc_free)
* [0x0C. C - More malloc, free](./0x0C-more_malloc_free)

All work contained in this project was completed as part of the curriculum for
ALX and partners. Holberton School with ALX is a campus-based full-stack software
engineering program that prepares students for careers in the tech industry
